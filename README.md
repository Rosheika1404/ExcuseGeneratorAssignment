# ExcuseGeneratorAssignment

<b>The Excuse Generator</b><br>
Disneyland for procrastinators and lazy people.

This project is ideal for avoiding someone annoying, it takes no more than 20 lines of code and it can save you for the rest of your life!

<b>The Goal:</b>
We wanted a project that uses very little Javascript but still with a very fun application. The excuse generator takes 20 lines of code, is super simple to understand and is the perfect first project for any beginner developer.

<b>Instructions:</b>
Please create a small website that generates an excuse each time a button is pressed
